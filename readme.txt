== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What features are free, and what's included in the Pro cloud library? =
All core features (18 blocks, 14.2k icons, 100 style cards, 406 patterns, 7 pages, full functionality) are free with no restrictions. The Pro cloud library offers premium templates to speed up development.

While you can **create the same patterns and pages from scratch with the free version**, a Pro cloud account significantly reduces development time.
= Why does MaxiBlocks have fewer blocks than other libraries? =
We take a different approach to block design. Instead of offering numerous specialized blocks, we've built extensive functionality into each of our foundation blocks. This allows you to create complex designs with fewer blocks overall, making the system easier to learn and more flexible to use.

Our 18 core blocks are highly versatile, as [demonstrated in our pattern library](https://maxiblocks.com/demo/). By focusing on a smaller set of powerful blocks, we ensure they're well-maintained and continually improved.

Unlike some libraries that restrict key features to encourage paid upgrades, MaxiBlocks provides full functionality in every block from the start. This gives you the freedom to build without limitations, regardless of whether you're using the free version or have a Pro cloud account. All our foundations block are free.
= Is MaxiBlocks compatible with Gutenberg and my theme? =
Yes, MaxiBlocks is fully integrated with the Gutenberg editor. For the best experience, we recommend using a block theme like Twenty Twenty-Four (TT4) or our own MaxiBlocks theme, which is currently in beta testing. [Join the MaxiBlocks theme beta](https://maxiblocks.com/free-maxiblocks-wordpress-theme/?utm_source=web&utm_medium=wp-org&utm_campaign=theme+beta&utm_content=Try+Beta). Our support team is here to help if you encounter any issues.
= What is a Pro cloud account? =
A Pro cloud account gives you access to our cloud library of premium templates and priority support. It's designed for those who want to streamline their workflow with professionally designed templates.
= How does the licensing work for Pro cloud templates? =
Once you have a Pro cloud account, you can use the templates on unlimited sites. The sites you create with Pro templates will continue to function and receive updates indefinitely, even if you don't maintain your Pro account.
= How can I learn more about MaxiBlocks' future plans? =
