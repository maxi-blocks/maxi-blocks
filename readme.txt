_"Ah, and the style cards functionality is genius. So much more advanced than any other WP theme that supports palettes. The product looks great. The icons are fantastic, and for me personally, the style cards will be very helpful."_

-- Ivan Arnaudov

_"This Gutenberg builder is the BEST I've seen so far, I love it. I'm just getting my head around the Ui, but it's very intuitive if one has used other builders. Love the blocks, templates, SO CLEAN, and looks amazing on mobile straight away. Can't wait for its public launch and pro version... To produce a great product like this among a really crowded market, is not EASY... Took some real ingenuity, research and some bravery. The team DESERVES it. What excites, is this is just beta. Where will it be a year from now, then two years from now? (Can't wait) Wishing you all continued success!!"_
