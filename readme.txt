Here's what users say...

_"Ah, and the style cards functionality is genius. So much more advanced than any other WP theme that supports palettes. The product looks great. The icons are fantastic, and for me personally, the style cards will be very helpful."_  -- Ivan Arnaudov, Freelancer

_"I love your philosophy of keeping the plugin and all its features free, rather than hiding some features behind a paywall as most companies do. And then earning your income from professionally designed page and block templates that people may want to buy to speed up their website creation, especially people or companies that have to build many websites. It is a win-win!"_ -- Ani, Early supporter

_“I like the settings and the power it offers me. You did a great job with the “one-click design change” that you offer with style cards while offering the power to change everything with the settings.”_ -- A. Ku, Online marketeer
