I’m a first-year IT student and my university recently began a 6-month WordPress course. In this course, I’ve learnt about WordPress themes and plugins like MaxiBlocks, [redacted], [redacted], [redacted] and more.

In the next few months, we need to create a website for a library as practice. We can pick any website builder we want to use for this project. I’ve checked out a bunch of WordPress builders and seen many how-to videos.

I think MaxiBlocks tops them all. It’s super fast and adaptable. I tried MaxiBlocks for a week and I can say it’s better than other builders. It’s really neat and well-arranged. _-- Lynn WordPress designer – Myanmar_
