# Skill: MaxiBlocks Responsive Design

## Purpose
MaxiBlocks provides responsive design controls to ensure layouts look great across devices. It supports six responsive breakpoints and flexbox/grid layout control for precise page structure across screen sizes.【F:README.md†L152-L161】

## Key Controls
- **Six breakpoints:** Tailor spacing, sizing, and layout at each breakpoint for phones, tablets, laptops, and large screens.【F:README.md†L152-L161】
- **Flexbox grid control:** Build responsive grids with flexbox and adjust column stacking, spacing, and alignment per breakpoint.【F:README.md†L152-L161】

## Common Patterns
- **Responsive two-column section:** Stack columns into a single column on smaller breakpoints.
- **Feature grid:** Show 3–4 cards on desktop and collapse to 1–2 on mobile.

## Accessibility Notes
- Ensure text remains readable at all sizes (font size, line height).
- Avoid hiding critical content on mobile unless there is an accessible alternative.

## Examples
- A services section that shifts from 3 columns to 1 column on phones.
- A hero layout that reduces padding at smaller breakpoints.

## Gotchas / Troubleshooting
- If layout shifts unexpectedly, verify breakpoint-specific settings for spacing and column widths.【F:README.md†L152-L161】
