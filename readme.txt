== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is MaxiBlocks? =

MaxiBlocks is a complete website building solution that combines the MaxiBlocks Builder, MaxiBlocks Go Theme, and MaxiBlocks Cloud Library. The Builder and Go Theme are free and open source forever.

The optional Cloud Library gives you access to 2,180+ patterns, 231 pages, and 11 starter sites to save time.

= What features are free, and what's included in the Cloud Library? =

All core features are free with no restrictions: 19 blocks, 14,417 icons, 100 style cards, 542 patterns, 17 pages, animations, dynamic content, custom CSS, and full functionality.

The Cloud Library offers premium designs to speed up development. You can create the same patterns and pages from scratch with the free version — a Cloud account simply reduces development time.

= Why does MaxiBlocks have fewer blocks than other libraries? =

We take a different approach. Instead of offering numerous specialised blocks, we've built extensive functionality into each foundation block. This allows you to create complex designs with fewer blocks, making the system easier to learn and more flexible to use.

Our 19 core blocks are highly versatile, as [demonstrated in our pattern library](https://maxiblocks.com/demo/). By focusing on a smaller set of powerful blocks, we ensure they're well-maintained and continually improved.

Unlike builders that restrict features to encourage paid upgrades, MaxiBlocks provides full functionality in every block from the start.

= What are starter sites and how do they work? =

Starter sites are complete, ready-to-use websites you can install with one click. Each includes all pages (homepage, about, services, contact, blog, archives, 404) with coordinated design and styling.

Install a starter site, then customise the content, images, and colours to match your brand. It's the fastest way to launch a professional WordPress site.

= Is MaxiBlocks compatible with Gutenberg and my theme? =

Yes, MaxiBlocks is fully integrated with the Gutenberg editor. For the best experience, we recommend using a block theme like Twenty Twenty-Four or our own [MaxiBlocks Go Theme](https://wordpress.org/themes/maxiblocks-go/), which is free and available on WordPress.org.

= What is a Cloud account? =

A Cloud account gives you access to the premium design library with 2,180+ patterns, 231 pages, and starter sites. Use these designs on any WordPress site with the MaxiBlocks Builder installed.

The MaxiBlocks Builder and Go Theme are always free. The Cloud Library just speeds up your workflow.

= How does the licensing work for Cloud Library designs? =

Once you have a Cloud account, you can use the designs on your activated domains. Websites you create with Cloud designs continue to function indefinitely, even if you cancel your subscription.

Cloud Library access is based on domain activations:

- Cloud 1: 1 domain
- Cloud 3: 3 domains
- Cloud 2000: 2,000 domains

= What happens if I cancel my Cloud subscription? =

Your free MaxiBlocks Builder and Go Theme continue working perfectly forever. They're open source with no restrictions.

When you cancel Cloud Library access:

- All Builder features keep working (free forever)
- All Go Theme features keep working (free forever)
- Any Cloud designs you already downloaded stay on your sites
- Your websites continue working perfectly
- You still get Builder and Theme updates

You just won't be able to download new premium Cloud Library items. Rejoin anytime to regain access.

= Do I need an active license for plugin updates? =

No. The MaxiBlocks Builder plugin receives updates forever — no active license required. Once you've used Cloud Library designs on a website, those designs remain functional forever.

Plugin updates, security patches, and feature improvements continue regardless of Cloud status.

= Can I use MaxiBlocks for client projects? =

Yes. The free Builder and Go Theme have no restrictions. Use them on unlimited client sites.

Cloud Library access for client sites depends on your plan. You can build excellent client sites with just the free tools — Cloud Library just speeds up the process.

= Is support included? =

Support is always included at no extra cost. Cloud Library subscribers receive priority support with faster response times, while free users have access to community support forums and documentation.

= How can I learn more about MaxiBlocks' future plans? =
